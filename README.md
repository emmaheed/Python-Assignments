# How to get started with python
1. Write the command `brew install python3`
2. Create a virtual environment with the command `python3 -m venv -venv` in the root directory of the project. 
3. Activate the virtual environment by writing the command `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Use the command `pip -V` to see that your virtual environment is activated.

## Install packages 
1. `python3 -m pip install <package>`: The package ends in the virtual environment if activated, otherwise global on the computer.  
2. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade <package>`

## Run python file
1. Run a python file by writing `python3 main.py`.
