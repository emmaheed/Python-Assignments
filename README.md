1. Write the command `brew install python3`
2. Create a virtual environment with the command `python3 -m venv -venv` in the root directory of the project. 
3. Activate the virtual environment by writing the command `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Use the command `pip -V` to see that your virtual environment is activated.
5. Write the command `install --upgrade pip` to have the latest update.
